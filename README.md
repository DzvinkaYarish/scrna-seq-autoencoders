# Single-cell RNA sequencing data meets Autoencoders

Recent advancements in single-cell sequencing technologies have enabled the generation of
extensive datasets comprising millions of cells. Integrating such datasets is crucial for conducting
meta-analyses to identify associations between cell states and patient conditions. However, the
batch effect, arising from varied experimental protocols, poses a challenge to data integration.
In this study, we addressed this challenge by applying the latest Autoencoder-based approach by
De Donno et al to integrate scRNA-seq data from three datasets of gene expression profiles
from peripheral blood mononuclear cells.
